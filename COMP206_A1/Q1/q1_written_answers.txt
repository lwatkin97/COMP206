a) The output is:
104kg
364kg
450kg
1000kg
1800kg
4900kg
29000kg
110000kg

I discovered this by running cat *.dat| cut -f1 -d " "|sort -n which reads the data files and sorts the data from the first argument separated by a space.

b) The output is:

24m
13.5m
6m
5.15m
4.5m
4m
2.1m
2.0m

I discovered this by running cat *.dat| cut -f2 -d " "|sort -n -r which reads the data files and sorts the data in reverse from the second argument separated by a space.

c) The elephant is heavier. I discovered this by running the bash file:

#!/bin/bash

e=`ls | cat elephant.dat | cut -f1 -d " "| tr -d 'a-zA-Z'`
h=`ls | cat hippopotamus.dat | cut -f1 -d " "| tr -d 'a-zA-Z'`

if [ $e -gt $h ]
then
	echo Elephant is heavier
else
	echo Hippo is heavier
fi

d) I changed the weight by getting the weight as an integer, adding two, and then replacing the term with the new weight without creating a copy of the file.

c=`ls | cat crocodile.dat | cut -f1 -d " "| tr -d 'a-zA-Z'`
new_c=$(($c + 2))

sed "s/$c/$new_c/" crocodile.dat

e) I removed the giraffe by running the command ls|grep giraffe|xargs rm. It outputs the files with giraffe in the name, and then takes the standard output and removes the files.
